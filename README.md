我們可以發現乘法表有個特性，就以十進位的來舉例，首先他們的個位數是左右對稱的，由下圖可看見，A和I列分別是123456789和987654321，而B和H列分別是246802468和864208642，也就是顛倒過來看相同，其他列也是相同道理，分別是CG:369258147、DF:482604826和E:505050505，而這個乘法表又有一個特殊的特點，如果X進位的X除以二能整除得到N(X是十進位)，那麼用那個進位所表示的數字，個位數如果是N或是0即是代表那個數字是N的倍數，以10進位來說，10÷2=5，則數字25、30因為尾數是0或5所以是5的倍數，而以6進位來說，6÷2=3，則數字23、50因為尾數是0、3所以是3的倍數。

(We can find that the multiplication table has a characteristic. Let’s take the decimal table as an example. First of all, their single digits are symmetrical. As can be seen from the figure below, columns A and I are 123456789 and 987654321 respectively, while columns B and H are respectively They are 246802468 and 864208642, which means they are the same when viewed upside down. The same is true for other columns, which are CG: 369258147, DF: 482604826 and E: 505050505.

 Also this multiplication table has a special feature. In x carries, if x divided by 2 can be divided evenly and then get n (X is a decimal), then in x carry, if the units digit of a number is n or 0, it means that the number is a multiple of n. 

In terms of decimal, 10÷2= 5, then the numbers 25 and 30 are multiples of 5 because the units digit are 0 or 5.

In terms of 6 carry,  6÷2=3, then 23 and 50 are multiples of 3 because the units digit are 0 or 3.)<br>
